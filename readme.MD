Lab 2: OO Fortune.

Due: Monday Sept 20 at the start of class. 

To submit: Please check this lab back into your GitHib repo by the due date. 

In this lab, we'll refactor the Fortune program from Homework 1 to use classes and objects.

The lab will be graded according to the specifications grading method described in the syllabus.Specifically:

A completed, on-time lab is worth 2 points. 

A lab that is late or incomplete is worth 1 point. 

A lab that is missing is worth 0 points.

We'll work through this in class together - please refer to the PowerPoint slides for details.

    Task 1: Open the Fortune class. Add getters and setters for each of the three instance variables.

    Task 2: Add three construnctors: a default one, one that takes three strings 
    (one for each instance variable) and one that takes one string and breaks it into three.

    Task 3: Add equals() and toString()

    Task 4: Implement FortuneTester. It should call each of these to ensure that they work.

    Task 5. Open the FortuneDB class. Add method stubs for addFortune(), deleteFortune(), find(),
    findShortFortune(), findByTitle() and findBySpeaker(). Then implement addFortune()

    Task 6: Create the FortuneDBTester.

    Task 7: Finish the loadFromFile() method in FortuneLoader. 

    Task 8: Create the FortuneLoaderTester.

    Task 9: Set up the FortuneTeller.

    Task 10. Back up and fill in the other methods in FortuneDB, and extend the FortuneTeller's userInterface method to call them.

Once you're done, submit your code to your github repo.
